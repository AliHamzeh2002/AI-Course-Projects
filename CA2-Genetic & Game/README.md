## Part One: Genetic Algorithm (Buying stocks using genetic algorithm)
### Problem Description
We are given data of some company stocks' prices from 2020 to 2022. The data includes the ```return``` of the stock and its ```risk```. ```return``` indicates that how much the price of the stock has increased in that time and ```risk``` is the maximum fall in the price of the stock. We have to give each companies' stock a coefficient (from 0 to 1) that shows how much we want to invest in that stock. We have some limitations: we have to have shares in at least 30 companies, sum of the risk should be less than 60% and sum of the return should be more than 1000%.
## Part Two: Game (Minimax For Othello)
### Problem description:
We are given a code for a game called [Othello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi#Othello) and we are asked to complete one of the AI agents of the game. The other agent chooses its moves randomly. We have to use minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
