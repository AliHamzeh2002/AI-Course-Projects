    "We are given data of some company stocks' prices from 2020 to 2022. The data includes the ```return``` of the stock and its ```risk```. ```return``` indicates that how much the price of the stock has increased in that time and ```risk``` is the maximum fall in the price of the stock. We have to give each companies' stock a coefficient (from 0 to 1) that shows how much we want to invest in that stock. We have some limitations: we have to have shares in at least 30 companies, sum of the risk should be less than 60% and sum of the return should be more than 1000%."

    "### Questions\n",
    "1. *What happens if our population is too big or small?* If we have a big population, It may help us in terms of finding the optimal solution in less generations because we have more diversity but the problem is it will take more time and memory. If the population is too small we have less diversity and we may never find an optimal answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *What happens if the population increases after each generations?* If the population grows with each generation, the diversity increases and it may help us but again it will take more time and memory. Also we keep the population the same to make our chromosomes converge to optimal answer and if we increase the population, it may harm the convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *What are the effects of crossover and mutation and what happens if we use only one of them?* Crossover makes better chromosomes by combining good chromosomes but mutation is mostly used to make better chromosomes by directly changing the genes of one chromosome and helps us escape a local extremum. For example if we check the best fitness in the population of each generation, we can see that it converges to a number and then a mutation causes it to diverge from that number and suddenly increase. So we can't solve the problem by only using crossover.(uniform crossover may reach the answer but it will take too many generations) and in general only using mutation won't lead us to an optimal answer because it doesn't have the effect of crossover, however in this case for some constants, only using mutation leads to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *What are some ways to find the answer faster?* We can play with parameters as I did in testing part to find the best values to find the answer as fast as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *How can we solve the problem of chromosomes getting stuck after some generations?* As I said in question 3, mutation usually solves ths problem. we could also use multi-starting and run the algorithm with different initial populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. *What can we do to stop the algorithm if the problem doesn't have any solutions?* We can define a maximum value for the number of the generations (as I did) and stop the algorithm if it reaches that limit. Then we can return the chromosome with the best fitness in out population."

So we search the game tree and for the enemy's turn, we choose the move that's the worst for us(Min) and for our turn we choose the move that's the best for us (Max). The problem is we can't search the game's tree until the end (because of memory and time limitations) so we should have a maximum depth. When we reach the maximum depth, we should evaluate that current state with an appropriate function and give it a value."

The idea is when are in a max layer, if we find a value that's larger than another value in other branches from the upper layer(which is a Min layer) We can prune the rest of the layer because the value of that layer definitely will not be chosen by the upper min layer. This is called Beta pruning. Alpha pruning is the same but this time we prune a min layer. Alpha-beta pruning is implemented and I tested the algorithm with pruning and without it to show its effect."

    "1. *What were the attributes considered in heuristic function and Why?* It was explained in details in Evaluation part.In general two factors was used to evaluate a state. Firstly the coins in the corners of map because they can never change and also have high effect on changing many coins. Secondly the total number of coins for each player which is an obvious thing to consider. I also wanted to add one more factors to the evaluation function but it needed more complexity and made algorithm slow. That was to check how many moves each player has. Because it's better to reach a state that our opponent is limited or even has no moves!\n",

    "2. *What is the relation between the minimax depth and calculated parameters in the test part?* If we increase the minimax depth, We'll have more chance to win the game because we visit more states in the game and can predict the game more precisely. The problem is we'll need more time and memory so we should pay attention to this trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Can we choose an order in visiting nodes to maximize pruning?* We can order our moves in a way to increase pruning. We have to check the better moves first. For example first we check the moves in which a corner will be capture because these moves will probably have better/worse values compared to other moves. We also can save the states that we have seen in a hash table with their value so if we reach one of them from another path, we can compare its value to alpha/beta and if pruning is not possible we check other moves in that layer. These were the ideas to improve pruning but I think in general there is no guarantee that we can always **maximize** the pruning. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Explain Branching Factor and tell how it changes as game grows?* Branching Factor is the number of children each node has in the graph. I think the growth of branching factor depends on the players' moves but in general it increases while the game progresses and at the end of the game it starts to decrease because there will be less possible moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Explain why pruning doesn't decrease the precision of algorithm?* Because for example when we are in a max layer and find a move with value more than Beta, it means that there is a min layer in our ancestors in which there's another branch with value less than our current move's value. So this move's value won't be chosen by that min layer and since we're currently in a max layer we will be able to choose only moves with more values than this current value so those values won't be chosen by that upper min layer neither and we can ignore them and don't check them. This won't change our result.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. *Why when our opponent is playing randomly, it's not the best choice to play with minimax algorithm? What else can we use?* Because in minimax we assume that our opponent is completely intelligent and make the best choices for each move but for example in this project our opponent was playing randomly and didn't choose he best option for each move. suppose We have a move that leads to 2 possible moves for our opponent and Both of those moves will reach a state with value 10. We have another move that leads to 2 possible moves for our opponent and one of them will reach a state with value 1000 and the other will reach a state with value 9. In minimax we choose the first move because if we choose the second move, an intelligent opponent will take us to a state with value 9 but if we know that our opponent is working randomly we can take a risk and choose the second move. We may be lucky and get 1000 or even we get unlucky we will get 9 which is not much lower that 10! So we can choose expectimax algorithm instead of minimax. in expectimax instead of finding the minimum in the opponent's layer, we calculate the expected value of all moves. Each move has a probability and its value will be multiplied by its probability and sum of these will be the value of the layer."
